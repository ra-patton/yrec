**YREC** is a modern & efficient public stellar evolution code delivering fast, precise models across a wide spectrum of initial conditions and physical prescriptions. Stellar evolution calculations from YREC have been used to study the physics of solar analogs, evolved giants, low-mass stars, rapidly rotators, and magnetically-active stars. With modern microphysics and prescriptions for rotation, surface magnetism, composition, and mixing, YREC provides a versatile foundation for tackling many different astrophysical problems. In the era of *precision* stellar astrophysics, YREC offers an open, performant, and lightweight alternative to existing codes.

To get started using YREC, consult the **[documentation](https://yrec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**. Try the [quick start guide](https://yrec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart.html) or dive into the [interactive YREC web interface](https://yreclab.github.io/).
